Where do I start?
=================

Depends on what and why you wish to use Python
How much you want to know about what is installed and where on your system?

One size does not fit all. There is no one best way. There are the ways
that help you be effective in accomplishing something you wish to do.

Like a good journalist, we have questions:
* Why Python?
* What Python?
* Where?
* Who?
* How?
* When?


Why?
====

Like the famous bridgekeeper in Monty Python, ask about your quest:

* Do you wish to build a website? (Web)
* Or analyze data and make visualizations? (Data science)
* Or teach a classroom of high school math students? (Education)
* Or create a game? (Games)
* Or a mobile application? (Mobile)
* Or analyze the air speed velocity of an Unladen Swallow? Or a drone flying
  across town? (Science)


Who
===

We're all different so let's first decide what appeals most to you:

* Free and easy - just web please - no local installation

* Point and click install - I don't want to program. I just want to use a cool
  library that has a function that will help me.

* Middle of the Road - Command line is fine but I want to keep it simple

* Understand what is happening to my system - not that I don't trust you but
  I want to be in control of my system

* Dotfiles and command line are awesome.
