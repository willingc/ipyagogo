Inspiration - Variety
=====================

Variety exists everywhere.

Favorite Soup
=============

Think of your favorite soup...

* Hot or cold?
* Noodles or rice or neither?
* Soup broth - vegetable, chicken, cream, etc?
* Proteins - Beans, tofu, fish, poultry, meats, nuts
* Ingredients - vegetables, fruits, spices

There are many variations of what we enjoy.

One Soup
========

Just one soup?

While some may enjoy only one type of soup and others due to life circumstances choose only one type, many do prefer different soups
to enjoy in a month or a year.
