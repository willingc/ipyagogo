Docs to get up and slithering


Python is a wonderful community and language. There are so
many individuals doing creative and productive work with 
Python.

This documentation hopes to add clarity to the installation
process when using Python and its many diverse libraries.

It is our hope to communicate that Python installation is:

* possible in a variety of environments
* expected to vary a bit depending on the end user, applications,
and computing systems
* provide a starting point to the python versions, tools, processes

This is very, very much a work in process.

Please send a pull request to add any helpful installation blog posts or 
tools or packages that you find useful. Others may find it helpful too.
