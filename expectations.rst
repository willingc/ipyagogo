Expectations
============

If I order a tomato bisque in a restaurant, would I be happy
if the server brought me a bowl of pho?

Maybe, maybe not. Either way, pho was not the soup that I was
expecting.


Expectations
============

Tomato bisque.
Tomatoes. cream. broth.
blended.

I'm envisioning the soup as I wait for the server to deliver.
New chef and server return with a chunky tomato soup.

Am I satisfied?
Partially. 

The ingredients may be the same but it's not what I expected.

What if when I ordered the server told me that the tomato bisque
is prepared with chunky tomatoes instead of smooth puree?
I would have a choice to go ahead and complete the order or to
select a different soup. Either way, I will receive what I expect
when the soup is delivered.
