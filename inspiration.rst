The elusive Quetzal
===================

Mission
-------
* Costa Rica adventure
* Find a Quetzal in the wild
* Rio Savegre

Where? Where?
-------------
Look for a certain fruit tree
In front of our cottage
Now that we knew where to look and 
understood enough of the bird's behavior
we had a much easier time of finding the 
Quetzals.
